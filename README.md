## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

My main focus with this project was to finally start to get to grips properly with the basics of CSS Grid, which I have struggled with. I confused myself a bit with how many columns and rows I needed initially to get my .team-builder and .karma cards to be able to overlap the other two cards on the outside and I decided to use a CSS Grid generator to just help me figure that out. Once I had figured out how many rows and columns I needed with the help of that CSS Grid generator, I wrote the code myself rather than copying and pasting any code the generator was giving me. I really want to understand it properly, rather than just relying on generators.

### Continued development

I want to build a few more simpler grid layouts with my new understanding of CSS Grid to really get to grips with the basics and then use it on more complex layouts. Would really like to be able to use the new subgrid feature at some point soon too.

### Useful resources

- [Jonas Schmedtmann's Udemy course 'Building Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS'](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/learn/lecture/27512260#overview) - I have really been finding Jonas' teaching style suits me more than any other I have come across. His real world examples really help solidify concepts and his explanation of CSS Grid is the first time I thought it was really starting to make sense to me. Highly recommended if you are struggling with the basics and putting everything together.

- [CSS Grid generator - Layoutit!](https://grid.layoutit.com/) - This is the CSS Grid generator I used to help me figure out the placement of my cards. Easy and quick to use. Well worth using if you are struggling to place items in your grid.
